- [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman)
- [Xcode 15](https://developer.apple.com/xcode)
- [Cocoapods 1.2.1](https://cocoapods.org)

- [Android Studio and Android SDK](https://developer.android.com/studio)

## Base dependencies

- [@fortawesome/fontawesome-svg-core]
- [@fortawesome/free-solid-svg-icons]
- [@fortawesome/react-native-fontawesome]
- [@react-navigation/bottom-tabs]
- [react-navigation]
- [react-native-screens]

## Usage


- A repository created from a template starts with a single commit.
- Commits to a repository created from a template do appear in your contribution graph.
- Creating a repository from a template starts a new project quickly.

## Folder structure

This project follows a very simple project structure:

- `src`: This folder is the main container of all the code inside your application.
  - `screens`: Folder that contains all your application screens/features.
    - `Screen`: Each screen should be stored inside its folder and inside it a file for its code and a separate one for the styles and tests.
      - `Screen.js`
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use     through
  - `assets`: Asset folder to store all images, vectors, etc.
  - `components`: Folder to store any common component that you use through your app (such as a generic button)
  - `theme`: Folder to store all the styling concerns related to the application theme.
- `App.js`: Main component that starts your whole app.
- `index.js`: Entry point of your application as per React-Native standards.

# Getting Started

>**Note**: Make sure you have completed the [React Native - Environment Setup](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) instructions till "Creating a new application" step, before proceeding.

## Step 1: Start the Metro Server

First, you will need to start **Metro**, the JavaScript _bundler_ that ships _with_ React Native.
You would need to install the packages for the project
```bash
# using npm
npm install

# OR using Yarn
yarn install
```

To start Metro, run the following command from the _root_ of your React Native project:

```bash
# using npm
npm start

# OR using Yarn
yarn start
```

## Step 2: Start your Application

Let Metro Bundler run in its _own_ terminal. Open a _new_ terminal from the _root_ of your React Native project. Run the following command to start your _Android_ or _iOS_ app:

### For Android

```bash
# using npm
npm run android

# OR using Yarn
yarn android
```

### For iOS

```bash
# using npm
npm run ios

# OR using Yarn
yarn ios
```

If everything is set up _correctly_, you should see your new app running in your _Android Emulator_ or _iOS Simulator_ shortly provided you have set up your emulator/simulator correctly.

This is one way to run your app — you can also run it directly from within Android Studio and Xcode respectively.
